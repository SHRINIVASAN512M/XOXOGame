**Flutter XO Game with MVVM Architecture**
The Flutter XO Game, a Tic-Tac-Toe implementation using MVVM architecture and with the State mamagement. This project aims to showcase the power of MVVM in Flutter applications, emphasizing a clean and scalable code structure.

**Features**
--> MVVM Architecture: Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern for clear separation of concerns.
--> Reactive State Management: Leverages flutter_mobx for reactive programming, ensuring smooth UI updates.
--> Scalable and Maintainable Code: MVVM architecture facilitates code organization and maintenance.

**Project Structure**
The project follows a structured MVVM architecture:
lib/
data/: Contains the data layer, including the game logic.
domain/: Defines the core business logic and models.
presentation/: Implements the UI layer with View and ViewModel components.
app.dart: Entry point of the application.

**Dependencies**
flutter_mobx: State management library for reactive programming.
mobx: State management library for the Dart language.
mobx_codegen: Code generation library for MobX.
